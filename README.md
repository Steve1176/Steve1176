- 👋 Hi, I’m Pansin Roman, as known as @Steve1176
- 👀 I’m interested in low-level programming languages as ASM or C and building digital hardwire! At the real way programming is just my hobby :)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning C language, so there will be a lot of programs that written for educational purposes or just for fun!
- 💞️ I'm looking for an opportunity to participate in projects that need someone who understands the development of digital devices
